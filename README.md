## How Does Social Vulnerability Impact Voter Turnout
### Tyler Applegate, Florence Cohort, 2021_07_21

### Project Planning

#### Project Goals:
    - Visualize relationship between CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and Voter Turnout in Texas Counties
    - Determine what, if any, relationship exists between those two
    - Establish a baseline model to predict Voter Turnout
    - Build at least 4 models based upon SVI to try to beat the baseline model
    - Adjust hyperparameters and variables until I am ready to verify my best model on Test Dataset
    - Draw meaningful conclusions from data
    - Outline next steps and recommendations
    
#### Project Deliverables:
    - Link to Trello work-flow board
    - Links to all datasets
    - README that details project planning, goals, process, results, conclusions, next steps, and steps to reproduce
    - Appropriate modules with my functions to replicate results
    - Modular Notebooks Detailing work at each step of the DS pipeline
    - Final Notebook, with detailed comments/key findings, takeaways, conclusions, and next steps
    - Project Summary
    
#### Project Context:
    - This CDC Social Vulnerability Index Data was pulled in from https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html
        - I selected 'Data & Documentation Download'
        - Year: 2018
        - Geography: Texas
        - Geography Type: County
        - File Type: csv
        - A copy of this data is added to the repo as Texas_COUNTY.csv
    - The Texas Voter Data was pulled in from the Texas Secratary of State website https://earlyvoting.texas-election.com/Elections/getElectionEVDates.do
        - I selected the 2018 General Election
        - 'Election Day Participation by County' - Statewide
        - A copy of this data is added to the repo as voter_turnout_2018.csv
        
#### Data Dictionary:
|Target|Datatype|Definition|
|:-------|:-------|:----------|
|turnout_percent|float64|turnout / population by county|

|Feature|Dattype|Description|
|:-------|:-------|:----------|
|socioeconomic|float64|Socioeconomic Status portion of overall SVI Ranking|
|composition|float64|Household Composition & Disability portion of overall SVI Ranking|
|minority|float64|Minority Status & Language portion of overall SVI Ranking|
|housing|float64|Housing Type & Transportation portion of overall SVI Ranking|
|svi_ranking|float64|Combined metric ranking of Social Vulnerability Index|

#### Initial Hypothoses:
- Hypothesis 1: We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
    - alpha: 0.05
    - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between socioeconomic and turnout_percent, (they are independent variables)
    - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between socioeconomic and turnout_percent, (they are dependent variables)
- Hypothesis 2: We reject the null hypothesis.
    - alpha: 0.05
    - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between composition and turnout_percent, (they are independent variables)
    - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between composition and turnout_percent, (they are dependent variables)
- Hypothesis 3: We reject the null hypothesis.
    - alpha: 0.05
    - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between minority and turnout_percent, (they are independent variables)
    - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between minority and turnout_percent, (they are dependent variables)
- Hypothesis 4: We reject the null hypothesis.
    - alpha: 0.05
    - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between housing and turnout_percent, (they are independent variables)
    - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between housing and turnout_percent, (they are dependent variables)
- Hypothesis 5: We reject the null hypothesis.
    - alpha: 0.05
    - Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between svi_ranking and turnout_percent, (they are independent variables)
    - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between svi_ranking and turnout_percent, (they are dependent variables)
    
### Executive Summary:

### Stages of the DS Pipeline
Planning -> Data Acquisition -> Data Preparation -> Exploratory Analysis -> ML Models -> Delivery

#### Planning
- [] Create README.md with data dictionary, project goals, come up with initial hypotheses.
- [] Acquire data CDC and Texas Secratary of State and create a series of functions to automate this process. Save the functions in an acquire.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.
- [] Clean and prepare data for the first iteration through the pipeline, MVP preparation. Create a series of functions to automate the process, store the functions in a prepare.py module, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the funtions.
- []  Clearly define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.
- [] Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.
- [] Train three different regression models.
- [] Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
- [] Choose the model with that performs the best and evaluate that single model on the test dataset.
- [] Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.

#### Data Acquistion
- [] Store functions that are needed to acquire data from locally saved csv files
- [] Combine tables into one pandas DataFrame
- [] make sure the acquire.py module contains the necessary imports to run my code.
- [] The final function will return a pandas DataFrame.
- [] Import the acquire function from the acquire.py module and use it to acquire the data in the Final Report Notebook.
- [] Complete some initial data summarization (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`, `.nunique()`, ...).

#### Data Preparation
- []  Store functions needed to prepare the svi and voter data; make sure the module contains the necessary imports to run the code. The final function should do the following:
    - Split the data into train/validate/test.
    - Handle any missing values.
    - Handle erroneous data and/or outliers that need addressing.
    - Encode variables as needed.
    - Create any new features, if made for this project.
- []  Import the prepare function from the prepare.py module and use it to prepare the data in the Final Report Notebook.

#### Exploratory Analysis
- [] Answer key questions, my hypotheses, and figure out the features that can be used in a regression model to best predict the target variable, turnout_percent. 
- [] Run at least 2 statistical tests in data exploration. Document my hypotheses, set an alpha before running the tests, and document the findings well.
- [] Create visualizations and run statistical tests that work toward discovering variable relationships (independent with independent and independent with dependent). The goal is to identify features that are related to turnout_percent (the target), identify any data integrity issues, and understand 'how the data works'. If there appears to be some sort of interaction or correlation, assume there is no causal relationship and brainstorm (and document) ideas on reasons there could be correlation.
- [] Summarize my conclusions, provide clear answers to my specific questions, and summarize any takeaways/action plan from the work above.    

#### ML Models
- [] Establish a baseline accuracy to determine if having a model is better than no model and train and compare at least 3 different models. Document these steps well.
- [] Train (fit, transform, evaluate) multiple models, varying the algorithm and/or hyperparameters you use.
- [] Compare evaluation metrics across all the models you train and select the ones you want to evaluate using your validate dataframe.
- [] Feature Selection (after initial iteration through pipeline): Are there any variables that seem to provide limited to no additional information? If so, remove them.
- [] Based on the evaluation of the models using the train and validate datasets, choose the best model to try with the test data, once.
- [] Test the final model on the out-of-sample data (the testing dataset), summarize the performance, interpret and document the results.

#### Delivery
> - Produce A Final Notebook that can be walked through like a presentation
> - Provide an Executive Summary to highlight the 'one big thing.' 
> - Clearly call out the questions and answers I am analyzing as well as offer insights and recommendations based on my findings.
