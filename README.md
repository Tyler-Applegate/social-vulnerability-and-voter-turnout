## How Does Social Vulnerability Impact Voter Turnout
### Tyler Applegate, Florence Cohort, 2021_07_21

### Project Planning

#### Project Goals:
    - Visualize relationship between CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and Voter Turnout in Texas Counties
    - Determine what, if any, relationship exists between those two
    - Establish a baseline model to predict Voter Turnout
    - Build at least 4 models based upon SVI to try to beat the baseline model
    - Adjust hyperparameters and variables until I am ready to verify my best model on Test Dataset
    - Draw meaningful conclusions from data
    - Outline next steps and recommendations
    
#### Project Deliverables:
    - Link to Trello work-flow board
    - Links to all datasets
    - README that details project planning, goals, process, results, conclusions, next steps, and steps to reproduce
    - Appropriate modules with my functions to replicate results
    - Modular Notebooks Detailing work at each step of the DS pipeline
    - Final Notebook, with detailed comments/key findings, takeaways, conclusions, and next steps
    - Project Summary
    
#### Project Context:
    - This CDC Social Vulnerability Index Data was pulled in from https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html
        - I selected 'Data & Documentation Download'
        - Year: 2018
        - Geography: Texas
        - Geography Type: County
        - File Type: csv
        - A copy of this data is added to the repo as Texas_COUNTY.csv
    - The Texas Voter Data was pulled in from the Texas Secratary of State website https://earlyvoting.texas-election.com/Elections/getElectionEVDates.do
        - I selected the 2020 General Election
