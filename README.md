## How Does Social Vulnerability Impact Voter Turnout
### Tyler Applegate, Florence Cohort, 2021_07_21

#### Project Planning
- Target: Voter Turnout as % of Population by County in Texas 2018
- Project Goals:
    - Visualize relationship between CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and Voter Turnout in Texas Counties
    - Determine what, if any, relationship exists between those two
    - Establish a baseline model to predict Voter Turnout
    - Build at least 4 models based upon SVI to try to beat the baseline model
    - Adjust hyperparameters and variables until I am ready to verify my best model on Test Dataset
    - Draw meaningful conclusions from data
    - Outline next steps and recommendations
- Project Deliverables:
    - Link to Trello work-flow board
    - Links to all datasets
    - README that details project planning, goals, process, results, conclusions, next steps, and steps to reproduce
    - Appropriate modules with my functions to replicate results
    - Modular Notebooks Detailing work at each step of the DS pipeline
    - Final Notebook, with detailed comments/key findings, takeaways, conclusions, and next steps
    - Project Summary
- Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses to Test:
